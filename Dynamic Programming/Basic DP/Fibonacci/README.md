# Fibonacci
The Fibonacci sequence is a well-known sequence defined as follows:  
Fibonacci(0) = 0  
Fibonacci(1) = 1  
Fibonacci(n) = Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)

Now, write a program that takes a natural number 'n' as input and prints the remainder of Fibonacci(n) divided by (10^9 + 7).

Note: This problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming (DP) and will encounter difficulties if solved using recursive or other methods to obtain the output within the specified time.

Input:
The input consists of a single line containing a natural number 'n'.

Output:
Print the remainder of Fibonacci(n) divided by (10^9 + 7).

### Example:

##### Input:
10
##### Output:
55
