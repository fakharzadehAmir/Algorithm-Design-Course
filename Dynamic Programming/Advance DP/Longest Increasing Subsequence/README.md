# Longest Increasing Subsequence

In this question, you need to provide an algorithm based on dynamic programming that has a time complexity of O(nlog(n)).

### Input

The input consists of the following:
- The first line contains a value n, which represents the number of elements in the array.
- The next line contains the elements of the array separated by spaces.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>

### Output

Output a single number in the output, which represents the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence (LIS).

### Example

**Input:**  
5  
2 7 4 3 8  

**Output:**  
3


*Sample Explanation:* The longest increasing subsequence in the given array is [3, 4, 7], which has a length of 3.
