# Longest Common Subsequence

Find an algorithm based on dynamic programming that calculates the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) for three arrays.

### Input

In this problem, the input consists of the following:
- First, three integers n, m, and k are given in reverse order, representing the number of elements in the first, second, and third arrays, respectively.
- In the next three lines, each line contains the elements of the corresponding array i (1 ≤ i ≤ 3) separated by spaces, according to their respective lengths.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ k, m, n ≤ 110

### Output

Output the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) among the three arrays.

### Example


**Input:**  
5 5 7  
1 2 3 4 5  
5 4 3 2 1  
5 4 3 2 1 6 7  

**Output:**  
1
