# Minimum Coins

Write a program that, given a set of coins and a target value V, outputs the minimum number of coins needed to achieve the target sum.

Note: If the target value cannot be achieved using the input coins, output -1.

### Input

The input consists of the following:
- In the first line, two values N and V are given, where N represents the number of coins and V is the target sum.
- The second line contains the denominations of the coins.

Constraints:
- 0 ≤ V ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 12

### Output

Output the minimum number of coins required to achieve the target sum V.

### Example

**Input:**  
3 30  
25 5 10  

**Output:**  
2  

*Sample Explanation:* By using two coins with denominations 25 and 5, we can obtain the value 30, so the output is 2.
