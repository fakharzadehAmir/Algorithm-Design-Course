# Diameter of a Connected Tree  

Assume G is a connected tree with n vertices and n-1 edges. Find the diameter of the graph, which is defined as the length of the longest path within the graph. (The diameter of a graph is the longest path between any two vertices.)  

### Input  

The input starts with the number of vertices in the graph, n, in the first line. Then, in the next n-1 lines, each line contains two numbers separated by a space, representing the edges of the graph.  

**Constraint:**  
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10<sup>5</sup>  

### Output  
Print the diameter of the graph, which is the length of the longest path within the graph.  

### **Example**  
**Input:**  
3  
1 2  
1 3  

**Output:**  
2
