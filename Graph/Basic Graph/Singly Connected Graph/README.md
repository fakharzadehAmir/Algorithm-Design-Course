# Strongly Connected Component   

David is celebrating his birthday, and since he has a keen interest in mathematics, David decided to give himself a directed graph as a gift. Due to David's condition of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), he only accepts the graph if there is at most one simple path between any two vertices in the graph.

David seeks your help to determine whether the graph he has in mind satisfies this condition or not.

### Input  
The input consists of two integers separated by a space, `e` and `v`, representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. Then, in the next `e` lines, each line contains two integers separated by a space, indicating the existence of a directed edge from the vertex with the first number to the vertex with the second number.  

### Output  
In a single line, print `YES` if the given graph satisfies the required condition, and `NO` otherwise.  


#### **Example**
**Input:**  
2 4  
1 2  
2 3  
**Output:**  
YES
