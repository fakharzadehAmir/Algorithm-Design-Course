# Knapsack  

Maria realized during a conversation with her friends in the garden that the price of groceries is going to increase. So she collected her honeycomb and went to the grocery store to sell it. Her son came to help her carry the honeycomb after the purchase and didn't want to inconvenience him more than once. She needed to fill her honeycomb in a way that she could spend the maximum possible amount of money on groceries, equivalent to one honeycomb, and prevent the impact of inflation on the goods.

The seller tells her the prices of the products and their availability. You need to help **Maria** fill the honeycomb while spending the maximum possible amount of money.

### Input
- The first line contains the number "W" (the maximum weight the honeycomb can hold) and then the number "n" (the number of available products in the shop).

- In the second line, the costs "c" of the corresponding "n" products will be entered as non-negative integers.

- In the third line, the weights "w" of the corresponding "n" products will be entered as non-negative integers. (Note that "c" is the total cost of "w".)  

**Constraint**  
1 ≤ i ≤ n  
0 ≤ c<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>

### Output
The maximum amount of money that can be spent on filling the honeycomb will be outputted as a decimal number.

### **Example**  
**Input:**  
50 3  
60 100 120  
10 20 30  

**Output:**  
240
